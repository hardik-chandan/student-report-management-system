# Student Report Management System
A basic CPP code written to make management of reports of students easier. This is one of the earlier programs I wrote while practising for object orientation in CPP. Reference for the code: [hackr.io](https://hackr.io/)

Things learnt from this project:
- File management system of C++
- Input data validation and handling
- Basic console application
- OOP basics like use of methods and attributes

## How to run
- Open the file above.
- Copy the code and paste it in your IDE.
- Execute the code and check for any errors that may occur due to your compiler.
